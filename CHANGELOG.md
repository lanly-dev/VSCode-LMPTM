### Note

- This release mostly has more significant impact on the dev side rather than like a product update.
- One funny thing is that the picture in README.md accounts for a large part of this extension's size.

#### [MediaSession](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSession)
- Soundcloud does update `playbackState` but only call `set` for from press play
- Spotify does call `set` to update metadata but playbackState always *none*
- Youtube and YTmusic update `playbackState` consistent with proxy `set` event

#### Puppeteer
- Seem Puppeteer doesn't keep track pages/tabs' order
- If click too quick, this shows up: `Error: Execution context is not available in detached frame "about:blank" (are you trying to evaluate?)`
  Waiting and try/catch was fruitless
