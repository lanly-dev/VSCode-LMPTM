### Issues/limitations
- Puppeteer's incognito mode starts with just one tab; you have to add more tabs manually, and <ins>it doesn't work with Edge</ins>
- Playwright with *User Data Directory* (aka *persistent context*) also only launch with 1 tab; need manually to add new tab, but the new tabs may or may not register correctly (event doesn't fire mostly, bug?), and noted that the <ins>initial tab won't work correctly - no pick button</ins>. You either launch a new page from the initial page's link or duplicate it to see the pick button show up
- SoundCloud no longer lets users listen without logging in; Puppeteer has trouble with this due to COR error, but and disable web security doesn't help since it removed origin from requests - SoundCould doesn't like that, but you can switch to Playwright to log in (you would stay logged in by using user profile)
- Ubuntu's Chromium at `/snap/bin/chromium` doesn't work - not sure why

### Notes
- The TODO - Seek backward/forward setting option <-- totally forgot what this one is about
- Persistent Context in Playwright: when you launch without a user profile/*User Data Directory*
Incognito mode is for Puppeteer only; it can only create one tab programmatically. Coincidentally, Playwright's persistent context also restricts to one tab only
- It seems like Playwright refers to launching the browser without *User Data Directory* as Incognito/InPrivate mode, which kind of makes sense except it doesn't have the dark theme associated with it
- Puppeteer follows the same direction for incognito mode, although it still has the `--incognito` flag, which actually enables the dark theme for incognito mode. However, you can't create new tabs within the same window programmatically
- Stopped looking into playwright/ppt-extra modules since those are all inactive
- Discovered that playwright-core cannot be bundled with webpack during publishing ðŸ˜µ, unlike puppeteer-core. As a result, the entire module must be copied, which increases the file count from 19 to 352 and the package size from 1.41MB to 2.34MB

- webpack 5.96.1 compiled successfully in 17898 ms
- 14 files, 243.83 KB, 1.95.0

### Notes
- I18n isn't necessary
- It seems like the VSCode extension sample code has moved to use esbuild instead of webpack, but you can pick either one
- ~~esbuild appears to be faster; however, after using webpack, it gave out errors every time the project was updated, and it was time-consuming to correct them --> this project doesn't use a bundler anymore~~ Have to bundle dependencies and esbuild doesn't support it --> back to webpack since *node_modules* is huge
- The logo has been changed for consistency with its menu vector
- Not sure if the Brave setting is still relevant

## [2.2.0] - September 2024
- Youtube CSP bypass [#15](https://github.com/lanly-dev/VSCode-LMPTM/issues/15)
- webpack 5.94.0 compiled successfully in 8730 ms
- 20 files, 1.4MB, 1.93.0

### Notes
- Chrome team added the [Trusted Types to YouTube](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/trusted-types-on-youtube) - thanks [Matthew](https://github.com/mattzgg) for the info
- There is probably a proper way to comply with the new security requirement but yeah, one shortcut is just to bypass it by disabling the [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
- It seems like the webpack in old project/machine that used to publish this extension is no longer combining files, another package stats from the new machine:
  - webpack 5.94.0 compiled successfully in 3000 ms
  - 15 files, 1.4MB, 1.93.0

## [2.1.0] - July 2024
- Fix Spotify and YouTube Music due to its UI change
- webpack 5.92.1 compiled successfully in 10241 ms
- 20 files, 1.4MB, 1.91.0

### Notes
- Updating this project to 3.0 was rough, so here is the minor release
- The Puppeteer@22 was having undesired bugs and behaviors
- Adding puppeteer-extra on top of it = more strange behaviors
- Why does Webpack's behavior change? - it doesn't combine files anymore

## [2.0.0] - December 2021
- Add new feature - treeview
- Rewrite/refactor most of the code - 30+ commits
- New float button style - old vs new in Windows<br>

- Fix Spotify bug due to its style class's changes
- Fix site English version issue - observes another DOM element to update playback status
- Merge play and pause commands into one toggle function
- Move most of the minor inject action to inject script instead
- Re-config project's configs like eslint, tsconfig, vscode setting, and webpack (.js -> .ts)
- Rename directories: icon -> media, scripts -> inject
- Playback icons are synced with the site's playback icons, which behaved contrarily before
- Webpack 5.65.0 compiled successfully in 9980 ms
- 15 files, 1.39MB, 1.63.0

### Notes
- This release mostly has a more significant impact on the dev side rather than a product update.
- One funny thing is that the picture in README.md accounts for a large part of this extension's size.

#### [MediaSession](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaSession)
- Soundcloud does update `playbackState` but only calls `set` from pressing play
- Spotify does call `set` to update metadata, but playbackState always *none*
- Youtube and YTmusic update `playbackState` consistent with proxy `set` event

#### Puppeteer
- It seems like Puppeteer doesn't keep track of pages/tabs' order
- If clicking too quickly, this shows up: `Error: Execution context is not available in detached frame "about:blank" (are you trying to evaluate?)`
  Waiting and try/catch was fruitless
