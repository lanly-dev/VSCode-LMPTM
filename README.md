Tired or get annoyed from switching windows in order to pause or skip a song?\
Doesn't want to or lazy to install the extra official players to the system?\
Or perhaps your keyboard doesn't have the handy media hotkeys?\
Wanted to stay focus on your programing instead of those shortcomings above?

If yes, you are in luck!\
This extension launches a Chrome/Chromium browser to the 4 popular music sites and you can control the playback from within your favorite Visual Studio Code editor.

>Extra [use case](https://github.com/lanly-dev/VSCode-LMPTM/issues/8#issuecomment-661796089) - you could use this extension to follow programming tutorials on Youtube with the handy seek forward/backward key shortcuts.
